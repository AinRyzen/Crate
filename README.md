# Crate
"Crate" Your Own GUI  
Create your own GUI Library in Python

## What to Use It For
Crate was built using Pygame, which is a game engine in Python. I started this project because I was getting bored with Tkinter and CustomTkinter. The scrollbar was terrible, and there were a lot of problems that I couldn't understand. So, I wanted to build my own GUI library, but I didn’t have much low-level computing knowledge.

That’s when the idea hit me — why not create it using Pygame? But Crate isn't just another GUI library; it’s a solid foundation for building a GUI library. With Crate, I wanted to give users as much freedom as possible to create their own widgets and customize everything.

Since I am mostly experienced with Tkinter and CustomTkinter, the syntax and philosophy behind Crate closely resemble Tkinter. This makes it extra easy for people with similar backgrounds to get started.

The documentation is now available:
[Crate Docs on GitHub](https://github.com/AinRyzen/Crate/tree/main/docs), 
[Crate Examples on GitHub](https://github.com/AinRyzen/Crate/tree/main/docs)

I haven't figured out how to use pip yet, so if you want to test it, download the Crate folder and place it in your working directory.
