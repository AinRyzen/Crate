# Crate
"Crate" your own GUI

## What to use it for
Crate was built on Pygame, which is a game engine in Python. I started this project because I was getting bored with Tkinter and CustomTkinter. The scrollbar was terrible, and there were a lot of problems that I couldn't understand. So, I wanted to build my own GUI library, but I didn’t have any low-level computing knowledge.

That’s when the idea hit me — why not create it in Pygame? But Crate isn't just another GUI library; it’s a solid base for a GUI library. With Crate, I wanted to give the users of this module as much freedom as possible to create their own widgets and everything.

Since I am only experienced with Tkinter and CustomTkinter, the syntax and philosophy behind Crate closely resemble Tkinter. This makes it extra easy for people with similar backgrounds to get started.
